A Python Script whcih takes input_firectory and output_directory and converts all the .ppt/.pptx files in the input directory to .pdf file in the output_directory

Purpose of this scrypt:
-  I am a student and had to prepare for my upcoming examinations, thus needed my teachers notes/uploaded materials
-  But, some faculties uploaded the materails in a mix of .ppt and .pdf formats
